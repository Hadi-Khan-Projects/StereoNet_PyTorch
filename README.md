# StereoNet implemented in PyTorch

Implementation of the StereoNet network to compute a disparity map using stereo RGB images.

Implemented using PyTorch Lightning as a learning exercise to learn about stereo networks, PyTorch, and PyTorch lightning.  Feel free to make any comments or recommendations for better coding practice.
